This is a test board with a 3-channel constant-current LED driver,
two-channel DDC112 ADC and an ATMega328 MCU.

An interactive CLI for testing is available in
`software/avr-clock-test`.

## Testing

Board#1 is in Lina's hands

Board#2 stuffing

* C1, C15 MIA so installed 0.47uF in place of 0.33uF

Running now.

T = 9800 works well



## ECOs

* External cap wiring incorrect.  For channel 1 two caps are needed,
on pins (3,4) and (5,6).  Same for channel 2

This is a test board with a 3-channel constant-current LED driver,
two-channel DDC112 ADC and an ATMega328 MCU.

An interactive CLI for testing is available in
`software/avr-clock-test`.

## ECOs

* External cap wiring incorrect.  For channel 1 two caps are needed,
on pins (3,4) and (5,6).  Same for channel 2
